    <h2>Asgard's Lore</h2>
    <p><i>Asgard, also known in Old Norse as Ásgarðr, was one of the Nine Realms of the World Tree, the fortified homeland of the Asgardians and the Aesir gods. High up in the crown of Yggdrasil, the realm was ruled with cunning by the vicious All-Father from his hall since time immemorial and was also the final home of the bravest fallen warriors from Midgard, to which Asgard remained connected via the legendary rainbow bridge. Traditionally associated with knowledge, war and power, Asgard was nevertheless promised to certain doom at the hands of the Jötnar at the time of Ragnarök, which drove the Asgardians to turn their homeland into a fortress and caused the spark of a ruthless campaign of conquest and genocide against all the other realms.

        The sheer power of the Aesir gods and their seemingly endless military ressources allowed the Asgardians to progressively subdue the Nine Realms, putting their enemies under firm political and economical dominance for the sole benefit of Asgard. As for the All-Father, his utmost desire to prevent Ragnarök from happening fuelled by his obsession for knowledge led him to greedily steal and plunder every bit of lore from all the realms he could possibly find. However, the Aesir finally met their match upon invading Vanaheim, the home of their steadfast rivals. In spite of their brute power, the Aesir severely underestimated the Vanir response to their invasion, leading both sides to a stalemate after centuries of war.
        
        Consequently, they concluded an uneasy truce in the form of a marriage between Freya and Odin, the two main leaders of their respective camp. But after a long period of peace, the fallout of their union drove the Asgardians to take advantage of Freya's banishement by Odin, and resume their military conquest, this time with success. Their brutal dominance eventually came to an end with Ragnarök, the onset of which was accelerated by the prophesied foreign intervention of Kratos and his son. The Ghost of Sparta united the Norse realms and used the legendary power of Gjallarhorn to successfully lead the invasion of Asgard, putting an end to the rule of the Aesir for good. In the wake of its destruction, its burning remants fell all over the other realms and became the rallying point to Odin's last servants.
        
        Asgard is a major location introduced in God of War: Ragnarök, though it can only be visited by Atreus a few times during the main campaign. Not only does the realm offer a singular and rather refreshing perspective of the Asgardian way of life, this is also the place where the character of Loki as well as his relationship with Odin and the Aesir gods are developped in depth.</p>
